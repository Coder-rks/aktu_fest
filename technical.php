    <h1> Description</h1>
<p>The designed logic circuit should be able to verify a truth table having up-to 16 input and 

output combinations. The truth table will be generated on the spot either randomly or in consultation 

with the participants. Please see appendix â€“ A for an illustrative problem. In addition following general 

    set of conditions are to be met:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use of circuit simulation software is not allowed.</li>

<li> Participants should bring their own set of components (as mentioned above) and other tools 

    and accessories (breadboards and connector wires).</li>

<li>They are advised to carry each component in sufficient numbers so as to be able to design 

    circuits of reasonable complexity. </li>

    <li>Participants are also expected to bring their own 5 Volts power supply. </li>
    <li>Organizers will only provide working space and easy access to AC mains power socket.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Marking and Winning Criteria</h1>
<p>Participants who have been able to implement maximum number of 

combinations from the truth table will be declared winner. In case of two or more than two participants 

end up tied, preference will be given to those who have used minimum number of gates. Gates created 

by making use of transistors will not be counted as gate (for the purpose of judging this event). In other 

words participants are encouraged to use maximum number of transistors to design their circuit. Even 

after the application of the above mentioned tie-breaker two or more than two teams end up tied, than 

the team clocking least time for completing the circuit design and implementation will be given 

    preference.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2> <p>Participants are expected to solve few real life coding problems by making use of computer

    programming (C/C++/Java).</p>

    <h2>Description</h2><p> The fully online contest will be conducted with assistance from a third party. The third 

party will design the problem statements and will also provide access to their online programming 

platform (Online Integrated Development Environment). The problem statement will become available 

at the stipulated time. Participants are expected to solve the problems by making use of the online 

programming platform only (the platform will include an online code editor and compiler) and submit 

the solution through the same platform within the stipulated duration. 

The problem set may have 7 problems. The participants are expected to solve these problems within 3 

hours.<br /> For a reference set of problems please see the following resource :

    </p>
    
    <h2>Marking and winning criteria</h2> <p>In general the winner will be decided by the ability to handle all the test 

conditions and efficiency of the program (in terms of time and space complexity). The third party will 

    solely be responsible for design and implementation of the judging criteria.</p>

<p><h2>Objective</h2> The participants are expected to build a robot that should traverse a maze consisting of black 

lines printed on white flex sheet. The teams are expected to build the robot from scratch. However they 

    can use open source prototyping boards like Arduino and Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>Arena description: The arena will consist of maze made up of black lines (30 mm wide) printed on white 

flex sheet (see figure). The maze is guaranteed to be without loops. The distance between any two 

    parallel lines will not be less than 200 mm.</p>
<h2>Description</h2> <p>Each robot will be given two runs. During the first run the robot should start from the black 

square (marked as start) and should ultimately reach the other black square (marked as end) covering 

each part of the maze. During the second run the robot should return to the starting point passing 

through the most direct route possible.

<h2>Marking scheme and winning criteria</h2>
<p>During the first run, for each end point visited, the robot will be 

awarded 10 points and will be penalized by 5 points for missing any. It is to be noted that there are 17 

end points. During the second run the robot will be awarded 10 marks for crossing each junction falling 

in the most direct path and will be penalized by 10 points for touching any end point. It is to be noted 

that there are 7 junctions falling in the most direct path. The team having maximum score will be 

declared winner. If two teams are tied at the end of the game, the team clocking less time during the 

second run will be declared winner.

<h2>Objective</h2><p> Two manual robots will be racing against each other in a circular race track having some

minor obstacles. The winner will be decided upon the ability of the robot to outrun the opponent 

without falling off the edge of the arena.
</p>
<h2>Arena Description</h2>
<p>The arena will be a 400 mm wide circular racing track made up of ordinary plywood. 

The inner diameter of the track will be 4000 mm. Arena will be parallel to the ground but fixed at a 

height of 300 mm from it. It will be made up of ordinary plywood. There will be two obstacles located diametrically opposite to each other. The obstacles will be stainless steel rod (10 mm diameter) fixed at 

a height of 20 mm from the surface of the racing track
</p>

<h2>Description</h2><p> The robots will start from the starting positions (marked as A and B) and both of them will 

move in the same sense (shown by arrows). The robots are expected to chase and approach the other 

robot from behind. Any dimension of the robot should not be less than 200 mm during all time of the 

game.</p>

<h2>Marking and Winning Criteria</h2> <p>There will be three rounds of 3 minutes each. Each round will end with 

the fulfillment of any one of the following conditions: </p>
<ul>
<li> A robot successfully chases its opponent and touches it from behind. The chaser will be declared 

winner of the round and will be awarded 10 points.
    </li>
<li>If a robot falls of the racing track. The opponent will be declared winner of the round and will be 

awarded 10 points.
    </li>
<li>The round will get over with the expiry of 3 minutes. None of the robots will be awarded any 

point.
    </li>

   <p> At the end of the three rounds robot scoring maximum points will be declared winner. In case both the 

robot end up tied the game may be extended by another round of 3 minutes. 

If the winner is undecided even by the end of the fourth round, the robot closest to its opponent 

(measured from head of the robot to the tail of the opponent and measured along the circular track) will 

        be declared winner.</p>
